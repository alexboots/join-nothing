# join nothing

Basic auth app using `graphql` / `apollo-client` / `express-graphql` / `passport` / `mongodb (via mlab.com)`. 
Most of the server side code is forked from [auth-graphql-starter](https://github.com/StephenGrider/auth-graphql-starter) with some changes. 
Frontend is using components from [react semnatic-ui](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

For development:
Make sure to have [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) installed and `yarn dev` (or `npm run dev`)

If deployed via dokku (or something that runs npm run start) it should be ready to go live. The production build could be improved greatly.
